# Toggle Image Project 🎭

This is a simple web project where an image switches between a **sad** and **happy** face when you click a button.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Click a button to change the image
- ✅ Uses basic JavaScript condition checking
- ✅ Helps you understand how to:
  - Select elements with `querySelector()`
  - Get and change an image using `.src` and `.alt`
  - Use string methods like `.includes()`
  - Attach `onclick` event listeners to buttons

> Make sure the `images/` folder contains both `sad.png` and `happy.png`.
